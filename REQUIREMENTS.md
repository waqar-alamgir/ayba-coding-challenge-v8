# Task: Matrix multiplication

Create a Laravel / Lumen application for Matrix multiplication. There should be an API accepting two matrices 

## Validation
For Matrix multiplication, the column count in the first matrix should be equal to the row count of the second matrix. If this condition is not met, the app should throw a validation error.

## resulting matrix 
The resulting matrix should contain characters rather than numbers - similar to excel columns. Examples: 1 => A, 26 => Z, 27 => AA, 28 => AB. At least the calculation itself should be covered by tests.

## Technical Details
* At least PHP 7.3 for coding 
* Laravel / Lumen
* PSR-12 coding standard
* strict type hinting
